# sample-Flask

### Imports:

- `import pickle`: Imports Python's `pickle` module, which is used for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- `from flask import Flask, render_template, request`: Imports necessary functions and classes from the Flask framework. Flask is the main class for creating a web application, `render_template` is used to render HTML templates, and `request` is used to access incoming request data.

### Flask Setup:

- `app = Flask(__name__)`: Creates a Flask application instance. `__name__` is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module.
- `model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl','rb'))`: Loads a machine learning model from a file named `model.pkl` using pickle. The `'rb'` argument specifies that the file is being opened for reading in binary mode.

### Routes:

- `@app.route('/')`: Defines a route for the root URL (`'/'`). When a user visits the root URL, the `index()` function is triggered.
- `@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])`: Defines a route for the `/predict` URL with the HTTP method POST. This route is used for receiving form data to make predictions.

### Views (Route Handlers):

- `index()`: Renders the `index.html` template when the root URL is accessed. This function simply returns the rendered template.
- `predict()`: Handles the POST request to `/predict`. It extracts the temperature value from the form data, uses the loaded model to make a prediction based on the temperature, rounds the prediction to two decimal places, and renders the `index.html` template with the predicted revenue.

### Template Rendering:

- `render_template('index.html')`: Renders the `index.html` template, which likely contains an HTML form for submitting temperature input and displaying prediction results.

### Application Execution:

- `if __name__ == '__main__'`: Checks if the script is being executed directly.
- `app.run()`: Starts the Flask application. If the script is executed directly (not imported as a module), the Flask development server is started to handle incoming HTTP requests.
